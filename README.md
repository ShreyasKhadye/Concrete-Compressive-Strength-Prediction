# Project: Cement Compression Strength Predictor

# Abstract:
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.

# Problem Statement:
We have to build a solution that should able to predict the compressive
strength of the concrete.

# Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
